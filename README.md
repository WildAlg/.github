# Scalable, Practical, and Adversarially-Robust Algorithms

Algorithms "in the wild" often encounter many challenges that are often not fully anticipated by theoretical models. Our lab seeks to provide practical, efficient, scalable algorithms for various problems and adversarial environments that can be deployed "in the wild."

Specifically, our lab focuses on:

- Parallel and concurrent algorithms
- Differentially private algorithms
- Dynamic/Streaming algorithms
- Distributed/consensus algorithms
